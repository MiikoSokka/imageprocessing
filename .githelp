When working with GitHub via the terminal, you'll typically follow a workflow that involves several key steps. Here's a typical workflow:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   This command downloads a copy of the repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch_name>
   ```
   This command creates a new branch and switches to it. It's a good practice to create a branch for each feature or bug fix.

3. **Make Changes:**
   Make the necessary changes to your code, documentation, or any other files in your local branch.

4. **Stage Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add <file1> <file2> ...
   ```
   This command stages the changes you made. You can use `git add .` to stage all changes.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
   This command commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.

6. **Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```
   Push your local branch to the GitHub repository.

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   Go to the GitHub repository in your web browser and create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main or master branch. This initiates a code review process.

8. **Code Review:**
   Collaborators or team members review your changes and provide feedback. You may need to make additional changes based on the feedback.

9. **Merge Pull Request:**
   Once your changes are approved, the branch is merged into the main or master branch.

10. **Update Local Repository:**
    After the merge is complete, update your local repository with the changes from the main or master branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

11. **Delete Branch (optional):**
    If you no longer need the branch you created, you can delete it.
    ```bash
    git branch -d <branch_name>
    ```

This workflow is a simplified guide; in real-world scenarios, you might encounter situations like conflicts, rebasing, or other advanced Git features depending on the project's requirements and collaboration strategies.
